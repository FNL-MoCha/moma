**************************************************
TSO500 Annotator Resource and Lookup File Creation
**************************************************

In order to generate an annotated MAF file from this pipeline, one must first
create a lookup table (similar to a Hotspots BED file) for analysis.  In fact,
the annotator will read a Hotspots BED file that is in Ion Torrent notation: ::

    chr	start	stop	REF=<ref>;OBS=<alt>	GENE=<gene>;TSCRIPT=<refseq_#>;CDS=<cds>;AA=<aa>;COUNT=<pub_db_counts>

However, the preferred method of annotation is now a lookup file in OncoKB 
notation that is stuctured as follows: ::

    <gene>	<refseq_id>	<AA_change>	<Oncogenicity>	<Effect>	<variant_id>

where: 

    - AA_change is in typical HGVS_p short format (p.Y253H)
    - Oncogenicity is one of OncoKB's terms (Oncogenic, Likely Oncogenic, etc.)
    - Effect is one of OncoKB's Gain of Loss of function annotation.
    - Variant ID is an HGVS-like string of <refseq>(<gene>):<aa>

More about how to generate this file is below.

In addition to the OncoKB lookup file, one needs to have a tumor suppressor
gene (TSG) file that contains a list (one gene per line) of genes that are 
considered to be TSGs in the data. 

Finally, in order to cover the NCI-MATCH assay for this study, one will also 
need a copy of the NCI-MATCH Hotspots BED file (not included in this repo) to 
merge into the final lookup file.

Making a Hotspots Lookup File
=============================
The Hotspots lookup file is comprised of the OncoKB `allAnnotatedVariants.txt`
file merged with a formatted NCI-MATCH Hotspots BED file, and labelled with 
additional oncogenic effect data, as the NCI-MATCH Hotspots file does not
include this data.  The final file will be generated by running the included
`tso500_hotspots_file_creator.pl` script, and requires a TSG lookup file, the
OncoKB `allAnnotatedVariants.txt` file, and a formatted Ion Torrent Hotspots
VCF file, which is the file that will take the most work to create the first
time.
